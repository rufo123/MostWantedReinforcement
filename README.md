Implementing Reinforcement Learning in Need For Speed Most Wanted: 2005

To be able to run it you must first of all have installed all the dependencies.

Requirements:
  1. Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005). As to my knowledge the game is no longer available to buy, so you must download it from somewhere e.g. (torrent)
  2. Extra Options for Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) v10.0.0.1338. Available here [NFSMWExOpts v10.0.0.1338](https://github.com/ExOptsTeam/NFSMWExOpts/releases/tag/v10.0.0.1338) <br>
    -> In config you must set the Windowed mode to true ( the values for it is 2 if I am correct) <br>
    
    WindowedMode = 2  // Runs the game in a window instead of full screen. (0 = False (Default), 1 = True, 2 = Bordered)
    
  3. The car used is Fiat Punto, unmodified so feel free to set it up yourself or take my save:
  - Located in: C:\Users\Rufo123\Documents\NFS Most Wanted
 
    
It is also recommended to use torch with CUDA support.
